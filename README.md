# CourseModellingUsingGraphs

This project will allow a user to input courses as vertices in a graph and will allow for a prerequisite relationship by using directed edges.
User will be able to ask to see the path from one sophomore course to a senior course. 
This is my first implementation and it uses an adjacency list consisting of an unordered map. I will try to create an implementation using an adjacency matrix as well. 
I will update with the usage as soon as I am done the full implementation.
